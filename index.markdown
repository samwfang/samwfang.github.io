# My Work at the National Institutes of Health \(2024\)
## Dr. Ovcharenko Research Lab: Drug Discovery Through Decoding Gene Regulation Systems

<i>Acknowledgements: I want to thank Dr. Di Huang, Dr. Ivan Ovcharenko, and the rest of the lab over the summer 
for helping me out on my first large-scale research project and in-person poster presentation! I felt like I gained 
so much knowledge not only about Machine Learning (including my first hands-on work with Transformers and BERT models) 
and Genetics, but also about Research, Reading Papers, and Presenting in general! </i>
