# My Work at the National Institutes of Health

<i>I want to thank Dr. Di Huang, Dr. Ivan Ovcharenko, and the rest of the lab over the summer for helping me out on my first large-scale research project and in-person poster presentation! I felt like I gained so much knowledge not only about Machine Learning (including my first hands-on work with Transformers and BERT models) and Genetics, but also about Research, Reading Papers, and Presenting in general!

I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work and learn from the lab and I hope that I will be able to contribute even more to the scientific world in the future</i>
