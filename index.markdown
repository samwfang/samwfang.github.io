    <p>Hello Everyone! My name is <b>Samuel Fang</b>, and I am a Senior Undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor.</p> 
    <p> I am hoping to be able to apply my knowledge and experience to be able to contribute to innovative ideas and projects, by working with logic and solving problems with simple, but elegant methods. Iâ€™ve worked on a large array of different projects pertaining to different skill sets, including writing code at the assembly level, writing OS code in C, designing machine learning models in Python, and implementing different algorithms and data structures in C++.</p>
    <p>I post my personal projects and writing here for anybody interested in my work and analysis.</p>
    <p>Please Feel Free To Contact Me At <b>swfang@umich.edu</b> or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-fang-295845227/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

# My Work at the National Institutes of Health \(2024\)
## Dr. Ovcharenko Research Lab: Drug Discovery Through Decoding Gene Regulation Systems

<img src="posterday.jpg" alt="poster" width="600"/>

<i>Acknowledgements: I want to thank Dr. Di Huang, Dr. Ivan Ovcharenko, and the rest of the lab over the summer 
for helping me out on my first large-scale research project and in-person poster presentation! I felt like I gained 
so much knowledge not only about Machine Learning (including my first hands-on work with Transformers and BERT models) 
and Genetics, but also about Research, Reading Papers, and Presenting in general! </i>

I presented this poster and my work on NIH Poster Day on August 1st, 2024 and NLM Poster Day on August 2nd, 2024.

### Summary

It is widely known that many genetic diseases occur due to mutations in the human genome. More specifically, certain 
mutations can occur in enhancers, which causes certain genes to be expressed more or less than normal. 

In addition, certain compounds, when used in treatment of cell lines, have been correlated with the up and down regulation 
of certain genes in studies such as the ones making up the SigCom LINCS database. 

Drug Repurposing is the study and process of analyzing the behavior of these compounds (which are ideally already FDA certified) 
to treat diseases or inducing certain effects by offsetting the gene dysregulation which is correlated with that disease. 
For example, Semaglutide (aka Ozempic) was used originally for treatment of diabetes, but was repurposed as a weight loss 
medication due to affecting expression of genes correlated with appetite management. 

While Drug Repurposing is a very mature field of study (starting in the 1980s), the traditional methods used to find out 
compound-phenotype relations often required clinical results. New advancements in bioinformatics have allowed for a deeper 
understanding of the effects of compounds on cell lines from a genotypic perspective. Machine Learning models can 
accurately predict transcription factor binding sites on enhancers, allowing us to understand the effects of compounds on the 
gene regulatory systems in the human genome.

In our poster, we highlight a new pipeline that attempts to better understand the effects of these compounds on gene regulatory systems and how new drug repurposing candidates could potentially be found by correlating compound treatment of cell lines with enhancer expression and transcription factor enrichment.
